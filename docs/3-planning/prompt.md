│ "Please review the system design documentation in 
/Users/avinashsharma/WebstormProjects/fartooyoung/docs/system-design/ to 
understand the current architecture"

And I'll be able to:

## Quickly understand your project by reading:
• **architecture.md** - Get the high-level system overview
• **database-design.md** - Understand your database schema
• **backend-design.md** - See your Lambda functions and APIs
• **frontend-design.md** - Know your React components

## Plus check your progress:
• **docs/planning/development-progress.md** - See what phase you're in
• **Current codebase** - Understand what's implemented

This means zero context loss between chats. I can immediately pick up where we 
left off and continue development without you having to re-explain the entire 
system architecture.

Smart approach! This documentation investment will save you tons of time in 
future development sessions.
